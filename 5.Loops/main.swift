print("=========================2.Experiment: The for-in Loop=======================")
print("===============================================================")
//1.  Create a for-in loop that:
//‚Ä¢  Uses age as the placeholder.
//‚Ä¢  Iterates over the range from 1 to your current age using the closed range operator .... For example, if you‚Äôre 35 years old, then your range is 1...35.
//Leave the body empty for now. There will be a warning even after you‚Äôve passed this step, but it‚Äôll go away once you complete the next step.
//2.  We want our for-in loop to help us print out the last part of the Happy Birthday song.
//Inside the block of the loop add a print() statement to print out:
//Are you [age]?
//Where [age] is replaced by the value of age in its current iteration.
// The start of the Happy Birthday song üéÇ

//‚Ä¢  from: 3
//‚Ä¢  to: 0
//‚Ä¢  by: -1
//That‚Äôs right, we can even go backward!
//print("We're starting in...")

// Edit the range 1...3 in the loop to use stride() üèÅ

//1.  Create a for-in loop that iterates over the characters in funFact using char as the iterator (placeholder) variable.
//Note: you will see a warning after passing this step, but it‚Äôll go away in the next step!
//2.  Inside the body of the loop:
//‚Ä¢  Add an if statement that checks if the character (char) is not an "x".
//‚Ä¢  Inside the if statement, use print() to print out the character (char).

print("========================5.Experiment: Using Underscore=======================")
print("===============================================================")
//1.  In Underscore.swift:
//‚Ä¢  Write a for-in loop that uses an underscore _.

print("========================7.Experiment: The break Keyword======================")
print("===============================================================")
//1.  In Break.swift, we have the structure of our for-in loop with a print() statement at the end of it.
//To complete the program, in the for-in loop:
//‚Ä¢  Add an if statement that checks if counter is equal to guessedNum.
//‚Ä¢  Inside the if body, print out the "It's [guessedNum]!!" and replace [guessedNum] with the actual value of guessedNum.
//‚Ä¢  After the print() statement, add a break keyword.
//After you pass this step, run the program a few times to get a sense of when break is exiting the loop.

print("===========================8.Experiment: While Loop==========================")
print("===============================================================")
//1.  In Guessing.swift, we have both a guess and a magicNum variable, each storing a random variable. We want to create a while loop that continues looping for as long as the values of both variables are different.
//Under the variable definitions (but before the last print() statement):
//‚Ä¢  Create a while loop.
//‚Ä¢  Give the loop the condition guess != magicNum.
//‚Ä¢  Reassign guess to Int.random(in: 1...10).
//‚Ä¢  Also reassign magicNum to Int.random(in: 1...10).
//Note: if you don‚Äôt reassign guess, you may end up in an infinite loop. üò± If this happens and the program is running forever, refresh the page!
//2.  To find out what the values of guess and magicNum are during our loop, add a print() statement inside the loop that uses string interpolation to print out:
//You guessed [guess], and the number was [magicNum].
//
//Where [guess] and [magicNum] are replaced by the actual values of guess and magicNum.
var guess = Int.random(in: 1...10)
var magicNum = Int.random(in: 1...10)
// Add your code here ‚ú®
