//1.  In LearnToCode.swift, we'll create an if statement that prints a message for you.
//First, declare a variable, learningToCode, using the var keyword. Assign it a boolean value, true.
//2.  On the following line, set up an if statement that accepts learningToCode as its condition.
//Within the if statement, print the message, "Don't forget to take breaks! You got this"
//3.  Reassign the value of learningToCode to false after the initial variable declaration but before the if statement.
//Observe what happens when you run the program. Did the message get printed?
// Write your code below

//3.  Create an if/else statement that contains 3 else if statements checking for the different values of abbreviation.
//‚Ä¢  ÔªøÔªøThe if and else if statements should check if abbreviation is equal to, ==, an abbreviation stored in the comment.
//‚Ä¢  ÔªøÔªøThe if and else if statement code blocks should each contain a print statement with the corresponding language. For example, if the abbreviation is FR, the String printed should be French.
//‚Ä¢  Use an else statement after the last else if statement that prints the message, Abbreviation not found.

print("===============================================================")
//1.  In StarWarsVillains.swift, we'll create a switch statement that determines the villain in a Stars Wars episode. We've declared and initialized two variables that will be used throughout our switch statement.
//First, create a switch statement that accepts episode as its expression. Keep the body of the switch statement empty for now.
//Note: You will see an error in the terminal on the right, but it will go away in the next step when we add case statements!
//2.  Within the {} of your switch statement, create case intervals using the following information:
//‚Ä¢  ÔªøÔªøEpisode 1 through 3: villain is "Emperor Palpatine"
//‚Ä¢  ÔªøÔªøEpisode 4 through 6: villain is "Darth Vader"
//‚Ä¢  ÔªøÔªøEpisode 7 through 9: villain is "Kylo Ren"
//Add a default statement that assigns an empty string, "" to villain.
//3.  After the switch statement, print villain.
//4.  Continue practicing in the editor by testing your code with different values for episode or adding more cases to the switch statement. Make sure it's working as expected before moving on.

print("===============================================================")
//1.  The 8 planets within our solar system are often categorized as terrestrial or jovian planets. In Planets.swift, we'll set up a switch statement that utilizes compound cases to determine the type of planet its given.
//First, create a switch statement that accepts planet as its expression. Keep the body of the switch statement empty for now.
//Note: You will see an error in the terminal on the right, but it will go away in the next step when we add case statements!
//2.  Use the following information to set up the case statements within the switch:
//‚Ä¢  ÔªøÔªø"Earth", "Mercury", "Venus", and "Mars" fall under the‚Ä®"Terrestrial planet" category.
//‚Ä¢  ÔªøÔªø"Saturn", "Jupiter", "Uranus" and "Neptune" fall under the‚Ä®"Jovian planet" category.
//‚Ä¢  ÔªøÔªøEach case should contain a print() statement that outputs the planet's category.
//Lastly, use a default statement that outputs Unknown planet.
//3.  Continue practicing in the editor by testing your code with different values for planet. Make sure it's working as expected before moving on.

print("=================10.Experiment: Switch Statement: where Clause================")
print("===============================================================")
//  1.  In Numbers.swift, we'll set up a program that determines if a number between 10 and 20 is prime or composite.
//Below the wholeNumber variable, set up a switch statement that accepts wholeNumber as its expression. Keep the body of the switch statement empty for now.
//Note: You will see an error in the terminal on the right, but it will go away in the next step when we add case statements!
//  2.  Within the code block of the switch statement, set up the following cases:
//  ‚Ä¢  ÔªøÔªøCase 1: Declare the temporary variable x and use the where clause to check if the value is divisible by 2. Print, "Composite"
//  ‚Ä¢  ÔªøÔªøCase 2: Declare the temporary variable √ó and use the where clause to check if the value is divisible by 3. Print, ‚ÄúComposite"
//The default statement should print, "Prime".
//  3.  Awesome work! This step is optional so feel free to hit Run if you'd like to skip it and move on to the next the exercise.
//Challenge:
//Instead of manually assigning and testing different values for wholeNumber, we can use .random() to generate one for us.
//  ‚Ä¢  ÔªøÔªøSet up the .random() method to accept a range of Integers between 10 and 20. Assign this calculation to wholeNumber.
//  ‚Ä¢  ÔªøÔªøUse a print() statement below the variable to output the value of wholeNumber.
