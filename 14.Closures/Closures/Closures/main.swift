// For this exercise we will create a game that calculates the sum of a hand of cards. We will make the game configurable such that it accepts a closure defining the rules for how cards are counted.
//1.  To start, create a function named handValue that takes an array of integers named cards and a closure named scoringRules of type (Int) -> Int. The function should return an integer which will be the value of the hand.
//2.  In the body of the handValue function, calculate the value of the hand with the scoring rules closure and return the value. Start by adding a variable named totalValue initialized to 0. Then apply the closure to each card by looping through the cards array. Return totalValue.
//3.  Define a closure named allCards that matches the scoringRules type in our handValue function that counts all cards. Call the handValue function with the allCards closure. What do you expect the output to be?
//4.  Define a closure named onlyEvens that matches the scoringRules type in our handValue function. The closure should only count cards if they are even. Use the isMultiple(of:) function to determine if the card is even. Call the handValue function with the closure. What do you expect the output to be?
let cards = [8, 2, 5, 3, 41]

//1.  Create a function named bake that takes a String and a closure as arguments. The argument names should be ingredient and completionAction, respectively. The closure should accept a String and return no values.
//2.  Within the bake function, print "Baking {ingredient}" to the console. Then, on the next line, call the closure passing in ingredient as its argument.
//3.  Below this definition, call the bake method with an ingredient as the name input, and an inline trailing closure that prints "Finished baking {ingredient}" to the console.

//2.  Next, call the function without the return keyword and exclude the return type. Print the result to the console.
//3.  Finally, call the function using shorthand argument names.
